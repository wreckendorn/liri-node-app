# liri-node-app

This is a Node.js app that is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

This app can be useful for quick info on my latest tweets, detailed song info from Spotify on any song you choose, or detailed info on any movie you choose. 

To get started, follow these steps:
1. clone the app
1. Navigate to the folder in the command line
1. Run npm install to install all necessary dependencies

LIRI accepts the following commands:

  * `my-tweets`

  * `spotify-this-song`

  * `movie-this`

  * `do-what-it-says`
  
For spotify-this-song, enter a song name after the command to get back song info

For movie-this, enter a movie title after the command to get back movie info

For my-tweets, no other entries are required - just hit enter to see my 20 most recent tweets

For do-what-it-says, no other entries are required. This command will read info from the random.txt file and run whichever command is entered in there.
